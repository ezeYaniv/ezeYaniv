# Hi, I'm Yaniv.

üßë‚Äçüî¨ I'm a chemical engineer-turned-software developer. I used to work on projects ranging from predictive analytics to alternative fuels, then taught myself to code, and now I work for Beyond 12, an ed tech nonprofit whose mission is to increase college graduation rates for underrepresented students.

üèïÔ∏è Between those two careers, I attended [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed educational retreat for programmers; embarked on a year-long backpacking honeymoon around the world (in 2020...you can imagine how that ended); side-hustled as a professional photographer; and watched a LOT of Udemy, Coursera, and YouTube tutorials.

üëæ My specialties include expert Googling, problem solving, and learning new skills and languages quickly. So far, I have JavaScript & TypeScript, CSS & Sass, HTML, React, Gatsby, Node.js, Express, Apollo GraphQL, AWS Amplify, and Material UI under my belt. I‚Äôm also picking up Python, Django, Google Cloud Platform, Vue & Buefy, and Docker. 

üéπ Outside of coding, I'm an obsessive reader, a keyboardist in funk & jazz bands, a photographer, and an avid nature lover currently into sea foraging and backpacking.
