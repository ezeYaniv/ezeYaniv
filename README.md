# Hi, I'm Yaniv.

I studied chemical engineering and spent 5 years creating innovative digital solutions for industrial manufacturing problems. I realized I loved learning and successfully implementing new technologies: this led me to pursue a career in software development.  

I created a self-study curriculum consisting of online courses (Udemy, Free Code Camp, Coursera) combined with personal projects to cement those skills. I'm a big believer in curiosity and imagination driving the learning process: my projects come from real problems I want to solve and fun ideas I dream up.

### Repositories I created recently
- [Kitchen Calc](https://github.com/ezeYaniv/kitchen-calc) - A web app to multiply recipe ingredients for your desired servings ([link to functioning app](https://kitchen-calc.herokuapp.com/))
