# Hi, I'm Yaniv.

In August 2021, I finished a 12-week batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed educational retreat for programmers. I learn best when I'm driven by my own curiosity and imagination; in Recurse, I found a community that encourages self-motivated discovery. Belonging to a coding community gives me the opportunity to learn from more experienced developers, teach others subjects I'm familiar with, explore new concepts, and develop verbal and collaborative coding skills - the "soft skills" that transform someone who simply writes code well to a good developer and team member.

I'm also working as a software engineer for a company developing an auction platform. In this role, I am responsible for building out UI views based on Figma design files. My 'building blocks' consist of custom extensible TypeScript React components based on the Material UI framework. I implement functionality by integrating React Router, custom React hooks, and Apollo GraphQL to fetch and modify data from an AWS Amplify backend.

Previously, I studied chemical engineering and spent 5 years implementing digital solutions for industrial manufacturing problems (predictive analytics, industrial IoT, smart dashboards). I realized the two things I loved most about my job were 1. figuring out how to use new technologies and 2. using them to solve a business need. Software development - an industry based on problem solving and continuous learning - felt like the natural next step in my career.

### Repositories I created recently
- [Treeify DOM](https://github.com/ezeYaniv/treeify) - This React + Express web app takes any URL, fetches & parses that site's DOM, and displays it in visual form - as a tree! Built with an Express backend which communicates with the React frontend by means of HTTP POST requests. ([link to functioning app](https://treeify-app.herokuapp.com/))
